## General Information
 The Case Study depicts the dataset related to customers who were approved loan in the past. The dataset contains detailed information about the customers who were able to fully pay back the loan within timeline and the customers who were charged off and not able to pay back the loan.
 Through data analysis based on the loan.csv, we are trying to figure out 5 impactfull variables that can predict the defaulters who apply for new loan. Rejecting the loan application for cutomers who are prone to default can save the probable business loss.
 
## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.12
- matplotlib - version 3.8.3
- ipython - version 8.21.0
- pandas - version 2.2.0
- seaborn - version 0.13.2

## Conclusions
1.Type of home ownership with respect to the customer's annual income can have effect on charge off.
2.Loan amount with certain interest rate can predict probable defaulters.
3.No of enquiries made by customers can be a good indicator for charged off customers.
4.Loan taken from particular state can also be a strong factor indicating chance of defaulting.
5.People with more outstanding credit line are more prone to default.
